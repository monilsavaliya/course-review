The professor was excellent, the content was genuinely engaging, and the assessments didn’t rely on rote learning. With a basic understanding of what was covered in class and the ability to relate it to your own life experiences, you can easily do well."
,,,HUL275,Naveen Thayyil ,3,2,1,1,4,"Grading was absolute (A : 80, A- : 72, B : 64, and so on). Attendance 75%+ mandatory to sit for major exams. But there were 3 bonus marks for attendance as well (lec + tut). Class is interactive, major minor mcq based in moodle, subjective surprise quizzes (best 2 out of 5). 25% of course load was a group ppt that took a lot of effort and time. 40% major, 25% minor, 10% surpise quiz. Lots of pdf to read. "

,,,HUL340,Divya Dwivedi,2,5,5,3,4,"Take this course if you're good at writing a lot of English. There isn't a lot of text to read through. I will recommend taking some classes so you understand how you're supposed to answer the questions, but it's not really all that important. Evaluation is nice, though you may sometimes fail to understand why you've got the marks you've got."
